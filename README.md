# CryptoPy

Python solutions to the [Cryptography I][1] Coursera class problem sets.

Usage can be seen by running the scripts `ps_{X}.py` without any arguments and
some input files can be found in the `data` folder.

All scripts are developed for Python 3 and are tested on Python 3.3.5.

## Problem sets:

- **ps_1**: OTP cipher breaking when a key is used more than once
- **ps_2**: AES decryption with CBC and CTR modes
- **ps_3**: video chunks integrity checking with SHA256
